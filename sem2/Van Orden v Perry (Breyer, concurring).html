<p><em style="font-weight: bold;">Justice Breyer</em><span style="font-weight: bold;">, concurring in the judgment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>School Dist. of Abington
Township </em>v. <em>Schempp</em> (1963), Justice Goldberg, joined by
Justice Harlan, wrote, in respect to the First Amendment's Religion
Clauses, that there is "no simple and clear measure which by precise
application can readily and invariably demark the permissible from the
impermissible." <em></em> One must refer instead to the basic purposes
of those Clauses. They seek to "assure the fullest possible scope of
religious liberty and tolerance for all." They seek to avoid that
divisiveness based upon religion that promotes social conflict, sapping
the strength of government and religion alike.&nbsp;<em></em>They seek
to maintain that "separation of church and state" that has long been
critical to the "peaceful dominion that religion exercises in [this]
country," where the "spirit of religion" and the "spirit of freedom"
are productively "united," "reign[ing] together" but in separate
spheres "on the same soil."&nbsp;<em></em>They seek to further the
basic principles set forth today by <em>Justice O'Connor</em> in her
concurring opinion in <em>McCreary County</em> v. <em>American Civil
Liberties Union of Ky.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court has made clear, as Justices
Goldberg and Harlan noted, that the realization of these goals means
that government must "neither engage in nor compel religious
practices," that it must "effect no favoritism among sects or between
religion and nonreligion," and that it must "work deterrence of no
religious belief."&nbsp;<em></em> The government must avoid excessive
interference with, or promotion of, religion. But the Establishment
Clause does not compel the government to purge from the public sphere
all that in any way partakes of the religious. Such absolutism is not
only inconsistent with our national traditions, but would also tend to
promote the kind of social conflict the Establishment Clause seeks to
avoid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as Justices Goldberg and Harlan
pointed out, the Court has found no single mechanical formula that can
accurately draw the constitutional line in every case. Where the
Establishment Clause is at issue, tests designed to measure
"neutrality" alone are insufficient, both because it is sometimes
difficult to determine when a legal rule is "neutral," and because</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"untutored devotion to the concept of neutrality can lead to
invocation or approval of results which partake not simply of that
noninterference and noninvolvement with the religious which the
Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive devotion to the
secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the
religious."&nbsp;<em></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither can this Court's other tests
readily explain the Establishment Clause's tolerance, for example, of
the prayers that open legislative meetings, see <em>Marsh, supra;</em>
certain references to, and invocations of, the Deity in the public
words of public officials; the public references to God on coins,
decrees, and buildings; or the attention paid to the religious
objectives of certain holidays, including Thanksgiving. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the relation between government and
religion is one of separation, but not of mutual hostility and
suspicion, one will inevitably find difficult borderline cases. And in
such cases, I see no test-related substitute for the exercise of legal
judgment.&nbsp; That judgment is not a personal judgment. Rather, as in
all constitutional cases, it must reflect and remain faithful to the
underlying purposes of the Clauses, and it must take account of context
and consequences measured in light of those purposes. While the Court's
prior tests provide useful guideposts--and might well lead to the same
result the Court<strong> </strong>reaches today, --no exact formula
can dictate a resolution to such fact-intensive cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case before us is a borderline
case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten
Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the
one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message,
invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Diety. On the other hand, focusing on
the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this<strong>
</strong>case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here
conveys, we must examine how the text is <em>used</em>. And that
inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain contexts, a display of the
tablets of the Ten Commandments can convey not simply a religious
message but also a secular moral message (about proper standards of
social conduct). And in certain contexts, a display of the tablets can
also convey a historical message (about a historic relation between
those standards and the law)--a fact that helps to explain the display
of those tablets in dozens of courthouses throughout the Nation,
including the Supreme Court of the United States. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the tablets have been used as
part of a display that communicates not simply a religious message, but
a secular message as well. The circumstances surrounding the display's
placement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting suggest that
the State itself intended the latter, nonreligious aspects of the
tablets' message to predominate. And the monument's 40-year history on
the Texas state grounds indicates that that has been its effect. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group that donated the monument,
the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a private civic (and primarily secular)
organization, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten
Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping
civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat
juvenile delinquency. The Eagles' consultation with a committee
composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian
text underscores the group's ethics-based motives.&nbsp; The tablets,
as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles
donated the display, a factor which, though not sufficient, thereby
further distances the State itself from the religious aspect of the
Commandments' message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical setting of the monument,
moreover, suggests little or nothing of the sacred. <em></em> The
monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical
markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled
in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time. The setting
does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious
activity. But it does provide a context of history and moral ideals. It
(together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates
to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles,
illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's
citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the
context suggests that the State<em> </em>intended the display's moral
message--an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of
Texans--to predominate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these factors provide a strong, but
not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument
conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is
determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the
presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until
the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of
any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation.
Hence, those 40 years<strong> </strong>suggest more strongly than can
any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system
of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in
any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a
particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over
nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any
"religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious
belief."&nbsp;<em></em> Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting
the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets'
message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message
reflective of a cultural heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case, moreover, is
distinguishable from instances where the Court has found Ten
Commandments displays impermissible. The display is not on the grounds
of a public school, where, given the impressionability of the young,
government must exercise particular care in separating church and
state.&nbsp; This case also differs from <em>McCreary County</em>,
where the short (and stormy) history of the courthouse Commandments'
displays demonstrates the substantially religious objectives of those
who mounted them, and the effect of this readily apparent objective
upon those who view them.&nbsp; That history there indicates a
governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an
effort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a
religiously inspired document. And, in today's world, in a Nation of so
many different religious and comparable nonreligious fundamental
beliefs, a more contemporary state effort to focus attention upon a
religious text is certainly likely to prove divisive in a way that this
longstanding, pre-existing monument has not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I believe that the
Texas display--serving a mixed but primarily nonreligious purpose, not
primarily "advanc[ing]" or "inhibit[ing] religion," and not creating an
"excessive government entanglement with religion,"--might satisfy this
Court's more formal Establishment Clause tests.&nbsp;<em></em> But, as
I have said, in reaching the conclusion that the Texas display falls on
the permissible side of the constitutional line, I rely less upon a
literal application of any particular test than upon consideration of
the basic purposes of the First Amendment's Religion Clauses
themselves. This display has stood apparently uncontested for nearly
two generations. That experience helps us understand that as a
practical matter of <em>degree</em> this display is unlikely to prove
divisive. And this matter of degree is, I believe, critical in a
borderline case such as this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, to reach a contrary
conclusion here, based primarily upon on the religious nature of the
tablets' text would, I fear, lead the law to exhibit a hostility toward
religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions. Such
a holding might well encourage disputes concerning the removal of
longstanding depictions of the Ten Commandments from public buildings
across the Nation. And it could thereby create the very kind of
religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to
avoid. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justices Goldberg and Harlan concluded
in <em>Schempp</em> that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"[t]he First Amendment does not prohibit practices which by any
realistic measure create none of the dangers which it is designed to
prevent and which do not so directly or substantially involve the state
in religious exercise or in the favoring of religion as to have
meaningful and practical impact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That kind of practice is what we have here. I recognize the danger
of the slippery slope. Still, where the Establishment Clause is at
issue, we must "distinguish between real threat and mere shadow."&nbsp;
<em></em>Here, we have only the shadow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these considerations, I
cannot agree with today's plurality's analysis. Nor can I agree with <em>Justice
Scalia'</em>s dissent in <em>McCreary County</em>. I do agree with <em>Justice
O'Connor</em>'s statement of principles in <em>McCreary County, </em>though
I disagree with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the
application of those principles to this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concur in the judgment of the Court.<br>
