<center><b>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</b>
<p><b><font size="+1">BARBARA GRUTTER, PETITIONER v. LEE BOLLINGER et
al.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT</b>
</p>
<p><b>June 23, 2003</b></p>
</center>
<p><b>Justice O’Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.</b>
</p>
<p>This case requires us to decide whether the use of race as a factor
in student admissions by the University of Michigan Law School (Law
School)
is unlawful.
</p>
<center>
<p><b>I</b></p>
</center>
<p>The Law School ranks among the Nation’s top law schools. It receives
more than 3,500 applications each year for a class of around 350
students.
Seeking to “admit a group of students who individually and collectively
are among the most capable,” the Law School looks for individuals with
“substantial promise for success in law school” and “a strong
likelihood
of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways
to
the well-being of others.” More broadly, the Law School seeks “a mix of
<br>
students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect
and learn from each other.” In 1992, the dean of the Law School charged
a faculty committee with crafting a written admissions policy to
implement
these goals. In particular, the Law School sought to ensure that its
efforts
to achieve student body diversity complied with this Court’s most
recent
ruling on the use of race in university admissions. See Regents of
Univ.
of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). Upon the unanimous adoption of
the
committee’s report by the Law School faculty, it became the Law
School’s
official admissions policy.
</p>
<p>The hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability coupled
with a flexible assessment of applicants’ talents, experiences, and
potential
“to contribute to the learning of those around them.” The policy
requires
admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the
information
available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of
recommendation,
and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute
to the life and diversity of the Law School. In reviewing an
applicant’s
file, admissions officials must consider the applicant’s&nbsp;
undergraduate
grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score
because
they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law
school. The policy stresses
that “no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant
to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems.”
</p>
<p>The policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible
score
does not guarantee admission to the Law School. Nor does a low score
automatically
disqualify an applicant. Rather, the policy requires admissions
officials
to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are
important
to the Law School’s educational objectives. So-called “ ‘soft’
variables”
such as “the
<br>
enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate
institution,
the quality of the applicant’s essay, and the areas and difficulty of
undergraduate
course selection” are all brought to bear in assessing an “applicant’s
likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the
institution.”
Ibid.
</p>
<p>The policy aspires to “achieve that diversity which has the
potential
to enrich everyone’s education and thus make a law school class
stronger
than the sum of its parts.” The policy does not restrict the types of
diversity
contributions eligible for “substantial weight” in the admissions
process,
but instead recognizes “many possible bases for diversity
admissions.”&nbsp;
The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law School’s longstanding
commitment
to “one particular type of diversity,” that is, “racial and ethnic
diversity
with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which
have
been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans,
Hispanics
and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be
represented
in our student body in meaningful numbers.” By enrolling a “ ‘critical
mass’ of [underrepresented] minority students,” the Law School seeks to
“ensur[e] their ability to make unique contributions to the character
of
the Law School.”
</p>
<p>Petitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied
to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 grade point average and 161 LSAT
score.
The Law School initially placed petitioner on a waiting list, but
subsequently
rejected her application. In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in
the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
against
the Law School....Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated
against
her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment;
Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. §
2000d;
and Rev. Stat. §1977, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1981.
</p>
<p>Petitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because
the Law School uses race as a “predominant” factor, giving applicants
who
belong to certain minority groups “a significantly greater chance of
admission
than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.”
Petitioner also alleged that respondents “had no compelling interest to
justify their use of race in the admissions process.....”
</p>
<p>In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School
actually
considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced
voluminous
evidence at trial. Relying on data obtained from the Law School,
petitioner’s
expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed “admissions grids”
for
the&nbsp; years in question (1995—2000). These grids show the number of
applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and
LSAT scores. Dr. Larntz made “ ‘cell-by-cell’ ” comparisons between
applicants
of different races to determine whether a statistically significant
relationship
existed between race and admission rates. He concluded that membership
in certain minority groups “ ‘is an extremely strong factor in the
decision
for acceptance,’ ” and that applicants from these minority groups “
‘are
given an extremely large allowance for admission’ ” as compared to
applicants
who are members of nonfavored groups. Dr. Larntz conceded, however,
that
race is not the predominant factor in the Law School’s admissions
calculus.
</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law School’s expert, focused on the
predicted
effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law School’s admission
process.
In Dr. Raudenbush’s view, a race-blind admissions system would have a “
‘very dramatic,’ ” negative effect on underrepresented minority
admissions.
He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority
applicants
were admitted. Dr.
Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered,
only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted. Under
this
scenario, underrepresented minority students would have comprised 4
percent
of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 14.5
percent....
</p>

<p><b>II</b></p>
</center>
<p>We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25
years ago....Since this Court’s splintered decision in Bakke, Justice
Powell’s
opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the
touchstone
for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. We
therefore
discuss Justice Powell’s opinion in some detail.
</p>
<p>In Justice Powell’s view, when governmental decisions “touch upon an
individual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial
determination
that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored
to serve a compelling governmental interest.” Under this exacting
standard,
only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice
Powell’s
scrutiny....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Justice Powell approved the university’s use of race to
further
“the attainment of a diverse student body.” With the important proviso
that “constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not
be
disregarded,” Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the academic
freedom
that “long has been viewed as a special concern of the First
Amendment.”
Justice Powell emphasized that nothing less than the “ ‘nation’s future
depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure’ to the ideas and
mores
of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.”
</p>
<p>Justice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in his view
race
“is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may
consider
in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.” For Justice
Powell,
“[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a
specified
percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of
selected ethnic groups,” that can justify the use of race. Rather,
“[t]he
diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far
broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial
or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.”
</p>
<p>In the wake of our fractured decision in Bakke, courts have
struggled
to discern whether Justice Powell’s diversity rationale, set forth in
part
of the opinion joined by no other Justice, is nonetheless binding
precedent
under Marks. In that case, we explained that “[w]hen a fragmented Court
decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the
assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that
position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the
narrowest
grounds.” 430 U.S., at 193..... We do not find it necessary to decide
whether
Justice Powell’s opinion is binding under Marks.... For the reasons set
out below, today we endorse Justice Powell’s view that student body
diversity
is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in
university
admissions.....
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<center><b>III</b></center>
<p>The Law School’s educational judgment that such diversity is
essential
to its educational mission is one to which we defer. The Law School’s
assessment
that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits is
substantiated
by respondents and their amici. Our scrutiny of the interest asserted
by
the Law School is no less strict for taking into account complex
educational
judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the
university.
Our holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree
of
deference to a university’s academic decisions, within constitutionally
prescribed limits....
</p>
<p>As part of its goal of “assembling a class that is both
exceptionally
academically qualified and broadly diverse,” the Law School seeks to
“enroll
a ‘critical mass’ of minority students.”&nbsp; The Law School’s
interest
is not simply “to assure within its student body some specified
percentage
of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.”
That
would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently
unconstitutional.
Rather, the Law School’s concept of critical mass is defined by
reference
to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.
</p>
<p>These benefits are substantial. The Law School’s admissions policy
promotes
“cross-racial understanding,” helps to break down racial stereotypes,
and
“enables [students] to better understand persons of different races.”
These
benefits are “important
and laudable,” because “classroom discussion is livelier, more
spirited,
and simply more enlightening and interesting” when the students have
“the
greatest possible variety of backgrounds.....”
</p>
<p>Even in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is
permissible to further a compelling state interest, government is still
“constrained in how it may pursue that end: [T]he means chosen to
accomplish
the [government’s] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly
framed
to accomplish that purpose.” The purpose of the narrow tailoring
requirement
is to ensure that “the means chosen ‘fit’ … th[e] compelling goal so
closely
that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the
classification
was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.”
</p>
<p>Since Bakke, we have had no occasion to define the contours of the
narrow-tailoring
inquiry with respect to race-conscious university admissions programs.
That inquiry must be calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by
the
use of race to achieve student body diversity in public higher
education.....
</p>
<p>To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot
use a quota system–it cannot “insulat[e] each category of applicants
with
certain desired qualifications from competition with all other
applicants.”
Instead, a university may consider race or ethnicity only as a “ ‘plus’
in a particular applicant’s file,” without “insulat[ing] the individual
from comparison with all other candidates for the available
seats.”&nbsp;
In other words, an admissions program must be “flexible enough to
consider
all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular
qualifications
of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for
consideration,
although not necessarily according them the same weight.”
</p>
<p>We find that the Law School’s admissions program bears the hallmarks
of a narrowly tailored plan.....We are satisfied that the Law School’s
admissions program, like the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell,
does not operate as a quota.... The Law School’s goal of attaining a
critical
mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its
program
into a quota. As the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell
recognized,
there is of course “some relationship between numbers and achieving the
benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers
and providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted.”
“[S]ome
attention to numbers,” without more, does not transform a flexible
admissions
system into a rigid quota....
</p>
<p>That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota
does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized
consideration.
When using race as a “plus” factor in university admissions, a
university’s
admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each
applicant
is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an
applicant’s
race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application. The
importance
of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious
admissions program is paramount....
</p>
<p>Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic
review
of each applicant’s file, giving serious consideration to all the ways
an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment. The
Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of
all
races. There is no policy, either de jure or de facto, of automatic
acceptance
or rejection based on any single “soft” variable. Unlike the program at
issue in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, the Law School awards no mechanical,
predetermined diversity “bonuses” based on race or ethnicity.....
</p>
<p>We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced
in
Bakke, the Law School’s race-conscious admissions program adequately
ensures
that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are
meaningfully
considered alongside race in admissions decisions.....All applicants
have
the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity
contributions
through the submission of a personal statement, letters of
recommendation,
and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute
to the life and diversity of the Law School.
</p>
<p>What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to
diversity
factors besides race....&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the context of higher education, the durational requirement
can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies
and
periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still
necessary
to achieve student body diversity....Universities in California,
Florida,
and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are
prohibited
by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide
variety
of alternative approaches. Universities in other States can and should
draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives
as
they develop.
</p>
<p>The requirement that all race-conscious admissions programs have a
termination
point “assure[s] all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal
treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a
measure
taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.”&nbsp; We take the
Law School at its word that it would “like nothing better than to find
a race-neutral admissions formula” and will terminate its
race-conscious
admissions program as soon as practicable.&nbsp; It has been 25 years
since
Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in
student body diversity in the context of public higher education. Since
that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test
scores has indeed increased. We expect that 25 years from now, the use
of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the
interest
approved today.....
</p>
<p><b>Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice
Kennedy,
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.</b>
</p>
<p>I do not believe that the University of Michigan Law School’s (Law
School)
means are narrowly tailored to the interest it asserts. The Law School
claims it must take the steps it does to achieve a “ ‘critical mass’ ”
of underrepresented minority students.&nbsp; But its actual program
bears
no relation to this asserted goal. Stripped of its “critical mass”
veil,
the Law School’s program is revealed as a naked effort to achieve
racial
balancing.....
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Although the Court recites the language of our strict scrutiny
analysis,
its application of that review is unprecedented in its
deference.....The
Law School has offered no explanation for its actual admissions
practices
and, unexplained, we are bound to
conclude that the Law School has managed its admissions program, not
to achieve a “critical mass,” but to extend offers of admission to
members
of selected minority groups in proportion to their statistical
representation
in the applicant pool. But this is precisely the type of racial
balancing
that the Court itself calls “patently unconstitutional.”
</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that the Law School’s program fails strict
scrutiny
because it is devoid of any reasonably precise time limit on the Law
School’s
use of race in admissions..... The Court suggests a possible 25-year
limitation
on the Law School’s current program. Respondents, on the other hand,
remain
more ambiguous, explaining that “the Law School of course recognizes
that
race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits....These
discussions of a time limit are the vaguest of assurances. In truth,
they
permit the Law School’s use of racial preferences on a seemingly
permanent
basis. Thus, an important component of strict scrutiny–that a program
be
limited in time–is casually subverted.....
