<p class="CASCTA">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> delivered the opinion of the Court.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider whether a
District of Columbia prohibition on the possession of usable handguns
in the home violates the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
to the Constitution.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;" class="opcentered">I</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District of Columbia
generally prohibits
the possession of handguns. It is a crime to carry an unregistered
firearm, and the registration of handguns is prohibited. Wholly apart
from that prohibition, no person may carry a handgun without a license,
but the chief of police may issue licenses for 1-year periods. District
of Columbia law also requires residents
to keep their lawfully owned firearms, such as registered long guns,
“unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device”
unless they are located in a place of business or are being used for
lawful recreational activities. <span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent Dick Heller is a
D.&nbsp;C. special
police officer authorized to carry a handgun while on duty at the
Federal Judicial Center. He applied for a registration certificate for
a handgun that he wished to keep at home, but the District refused. He
thereafter filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the
District of Columbia seeking, on <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
grounds, to enjoin the city from enforcing the bar on the registration
of handguns, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibits the
carrying of a firearm in the home without a license, and the
trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibits the use of “functional
firearms within the home.” The District Court dismissed
respondent’s complaint. The Court of Appeals for the District
of&nbsp;Columbia Circuit, construing his complaint as seeking the right
to
render a firearm operable and carry it about his home in that condition
only when necessary for self-defense,<span class=""></span> reversed.
It held that the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
protects an individual right to possess firearms and that the city’s
total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the
home be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self-defense,
violated that right. The Court of Appeals directed the District Court
to enter summary judgment for respondent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We granted certiorari. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;" class="opcentered">II</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn first to the
meaning of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> .</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;" class="opcentered">A</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
provides: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of
a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not
be infringed.” In interpreting this text, we are guided by the
principle that “[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the
voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as
distinguished from technical meaning.” Normal meaning may of course
include an
idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that
would not have been known to ordinary citizens in the founding
generation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides in this case
have set out very
different interpretations of the Amendment. Petitioners and today’s
dissenting Justices believe that it protects only the right to possess
and carry a firearm in connection with militia service. Respondent
argues that it protects an individual right to
possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use
that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within
the home. <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its
operative clause. The former does not limit the latter grammatically,
but rather announces a purpose. The Amendment could be rephrased,
“Because a well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a
free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be
infringed.” Although this structure of the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
is unique in our Constitution, other legal documents of the founding
era, particularly individual-rights provisions of state constitutions,
commonly included a prefatory statement of purpose. <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic demands that there be
a link between the stated purpose and the command.... But apart from
that clarifying function, a prefatory clause
does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause. “It is
nothing unusual in acts … for the enacting part to go beyond
the preamble; the remedy often extends beyond the particular act or
mischief which first suggested the necessity of the law.” Therefore,
while we will begin our textual analysis with the operative
clause, we will return to the prefatory clause to ensure that our
reading of the operative clause is consistent with the announced
purpose.<span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">1.&nbsp;Operative Clause.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">a.&nbsp;“Right of the People.” </span>The
first salient
feature of the operative clause is that it codifies a “right of the
people.” The unamended Constitution and the Bill of Rights use the
phrase “right of the people” two other times, in the <span class="subref">First Amendment</span> ’s Assembly-and-Petition Clause
and in the <span class="subref">Fourth Amendment</span> ’s
Search-and-Seizure Clause. The <span class="subref">Ninth Amendment</span>
uses very similar terminology. All three of these instances
unambiguously
refer to individual rights, not “collective” rights, or rights that may
be exercised only through participation in some corporate body.<span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three provisions of the
Constitution refer to
“the people” in a context other than “rights”—the famous preamble (“We
the people”), §2 of Article I (providing that “the people” will
choose
members of the House), and the <span class="subref">Tenth Amendment</span>
(providing that those powers not given the Federal Government remain
with “the States” or “the people”). Those provisions arguably refer to
“the people” acting collectively—but they deal with the exercise or
reservation of powers, not rights. Nowhere else in the Constitution
does a “right” attributed to “the people” refer to anything other than
an individual right....<span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">As we will describe below, the “militia” in
colonial America
consisted of a subset of “the people”—those who were male, able bodied,
and within a certain age range. Reading the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
as protecting only the right to “keep and bear Arms” in an organized
militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause’s description
of the holder of that right as “the people.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We start therefore with a
strong presumption that the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;b.&nbsp;“Keep
and bear Arms.”</span> We move now from the
holder of the right—“the people”—to the substance of the right: “to
keep and bear Arms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before addressing the verbs
“keep” and “bear,”
we interpret their object: “Arms.” The 18th-century meaning is no
different from the meaning today. The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson’s
dictionary defined “arms” as “weapons of offence, or armour of
defence.” The term was applied, then as now, to weapons
that were not specifically designed for military use and were not
employed in a military capacity.... <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have made the
argument, bordering on the
frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are
protected by the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> . We do
not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the <span class="subref">First Amendment</span> protects modern forms of
communications, <i></i>and the <span class="subref">Fourth Amendment</span>
applies to modern forms of search, <i></i>the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> extends, prima facie,to all instruments that
constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the
time of the founding.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn to the phrases
“keep arms” and “bear
arms.” Johnson defined “keep” as, most relevantly, “[t]o retain; not to
lose,” and “[t]o have in custody.” Webster defined it as
“[t]o hold; to retain in one’s power or possession.” No party has
apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of “keep Arms.” Thus, the most
natural reading of “keep Arms” in the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> is to “have weapons.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase “keep arms” was
not prevalent in the
written documents of the founding period that we have found, but there
are a few examples, all of which favor viewing the right to “keep Arms”
as an individual right unconnected with militia service.... “Keep
arms” was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for
militiamen and everyone else.<span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the founding, as
now, to “bear”
meant to “carry.” When used with “arms,” however,
the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular
purpose—confrontation....Although the phrase
implies that the carrying of the weapon is for the purpose of
“offensive or defensive action,” it in no way connotes participation in
a structured military organization.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our review of
founding-era sources, we
conclude that this natural meaning was also the meaning that “bear
arms” had in the 18th century. In numerous instances, “bear arms” was
unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an
organized militia. The most prominent examples are those most relevant
to the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
: Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or
the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens
to “bear arms in defense of themselves and the state” or “bear arms in
defense of himself and the state.” <span class=""></span>It is clear
from those formulations that “bear arms” did not refer only
to carrying a weapon in an organized military unit... <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, the meaning of
“bear arms” that petitioners and J<span class="smallcaps">ustice Stevens</span>
propose is <i>not even</i>
the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid
definition, whereby “bear arms” connotes the actual carrying of arms
(and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an
organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and
we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that
meaning at the time of the founding. But it is easy to see why
petitioners and the dissent are driven to the hybrid definition. Giving
“bear Arms” its idiomatic meaning would cause the protected right to
consist of the right to be a soldier or to wage war—an absurdity that
no commentator has ever endorsed. Worse still, the phrase “keep and
bear Arms” would
be incoherent. The word “Arms” would have two different meanings at
once: “weapons” (as the object of “keep”) and (as the object of “bear”)
one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying “He filled and
kicked the bucket” to mean “He filled the bucket and died.”
Grotesque....</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smallcaps">Justice
Stevens</span> points to a study by <i>amici</i> supposedly showing
that the phrase “bear arms” was most frequently used in the military
context. Of course, as we have said, the
fact that the phrase was commonly used in a particular context does not
show that it is limited to that context, and, in any event, we have
given many sources where the phrase was used in nonmilitary contexts....
<span class=""></span></p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">
c.&nbsp;Meaning of the Operative Clause.</span> Putting all
of these textual elements together, we find that they guarantee the
individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.
This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> . We look to this because it
has always been widely understood that the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> , like the First and <span class="subref">Fourth
Amendment</span>s, codified a <i>pre-existing</i> right. The very text
of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> implicitly
recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it
“shall not be infringed....” <span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to us no
doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> conferred an individual right
to keep and bear arms. Of course the right was not unlimited, just as
the <span class="subref">First Amendment</span> ’s right of free
speech was not. Thus, we do not read the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for <i>any
sort</i> of confrontation, just as we do not read the <span class="subref">First Amendment</span> to protect the right of citizens
to speak for <i>any purpose</i>. Before turning to limitations upon
the individual right, however, we must determine whether the prefatory
clause of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> comports
with our interpretation of the operative clause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.&nbsp;Prefatory Clause.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prefatory clause reads:
“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State …&nbsp;.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;a.&nbsp;“Well-Regulated
Militia.”</span> In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>
(1939)
, we explained that “the Militia comprised all males physically capable
of acting in concert for the common defense.” That definition comports
with founding-era sources. <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petitioners take a
seemingly narrower view of
the militia, stating that “[m]ilitias are the state- and
congressionally-regulated military forces described in the Militia
Clauses (art. I, §8, cls. 15–16).” Although
we agree with petitioners’ interpretive assumption that “militia” means
the same thing in Article I and the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
, we believe that petitioners identify the wrong thing, namely, the
organized militia. Unlike armies and navies, which Congress is given
the power to create (“to raise … Armies”; “to provide … a Navy,”
Art.&nbsp;I, §8, cls. 12–13), the militia is assumed by Article I
already to
be <i>in existence</i>. Congress is given the power to “provide for
calling forth the militia,” and the power not to create,
but to “organiz[e]” it—and not to organize “a” militia, which is what
one would expect if the militia were to be a federal creation, but to
organize “the” militia, connoting a body already in existence. This is
fully consistent with the ordinary definition of the
militia as all able-bodied men.... Although the militia consists of all
able-bodied
men, the federally organized militia may consist of a subset of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the adjective
“well-regulated” implies
nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training. <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;b.&nbsp;“Security
of a Free State.”</span> The phrase
“security of a free state” meant “security of a free polity,” not
security of each of the several States as the dissent below argued.
Joseph Story wrote in his treatise on the
Constitution that “the word ‘state’ is used in various senses [and in]
its most enlarged sense, it means the people composing a particular
nation or community.” It is true that the term “State” elsewhere in the
Constitution refers to individual States, but the phrase “security of a
free state” and close variations seem to have been terms of art in
18th-century political discourse, meaning a “&nbsp;‘free
country’&nbsp;” or free
polity.... <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why
the militia was
thought to be “necessary to the security of a free state.” First, of
course, it is useful in repelling invasions and
suppressing insurrections. Second, it renders large standing armies
unnecessary—an argument that Alexander Hamilton made in favor of
federal control over the militia. Third, when the able-bodied men
of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to
resist tyranny.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="bodytext">3.&nbsp;Relationship
between Prefatory Clause and Operative Clause</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reach the question,
then: Does the preface
fit with an operative clause that creates an individual right to keep
and bear arms? It fits perfectly, once one knows the history that the
founding generation knew and that we have described above. That history
showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all
the able-bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking
away the people’s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to
suppress political opponents. This is what had occurred in England that
prompted codification of the right to have arms in the English Bill of
Rights.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate with respect to
the right to keep
and bear arms, as with other guarantees in the Bill of Rights, was not
over whether it was desirable (all agreed that it was) but over whether
it needed to be codified in the Constitution. During the 1788
ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm
the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select
militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.... It was understood
across the political spectrum that the right
helped to secure the ideal of a citizen militia, which might be
necessary to oppose an oppressive military force if the constitutional
order broke down.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore entirely
sensible that the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
’s prefatory clause announces the purpose for which the right was
codified: to prevent elimination of the militia. The prefatory clause
does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason
Americans valued the ancient right; most undoubtedly thought it even
more important for self-defense and hunting. But the threat that the
new Federal Government would destroy the citizens’ militia by taking
away their arms was the reason that right—unlike some other English
rights—was codified in a written Constitution....&nbsp;<span class="smallcaps"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="opcentered">&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span></p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interpretation is
confirmed by analogous
arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and
immediately followed adoption of the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> .... <br>
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span></div>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now ask whether any of
our precedents forecloses the conclusions we have reached about the
meaning of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>...</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smallcaps">Justice
Stevens </span>places overwhelming reliance upon this Court’s decision
in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Miller</i><span class="subref"></span>
(1939)
. “[H]undreds of judges,” we are told, “have relied on the view of the
amendment we endorsed there,” and “[e]ven if the textual and historical
arguments on both side
of the issue were evenly balanced, respect for the well-settled views
of all of our predecessors on this Court, and for the rule of law
itself … would prevent most jurists from endorsing such a dramatic
upheaval in the law.” <i></i>And what is, according to <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span>, the holding of <i>Miller </i>that
demands such obeisance? That the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
“protects the right to keep and bear arms for certain military
purposes, but that it does not curtail the legislature’s power to
regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons.”&nbsp;<i></i> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing so clearly
demonstrates the weakness of <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span>’
case. <i>Miller </i>did not hold that and cannot possibly be read to
have held that. The judgment in the case upheld against a <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
challenge two men’s federal convictions for transporting an
unregistered short-barreled shotgun in interstate commerce, in
violation of the National Firearms Act<span class="subref"></span>. It
is entirely clear that the Court’s basis for saying that the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> did not apply was <i>not </i>that
the defendants were “bear[ing] arms” not “for … military purposes” but
for “nonmilitary use.” Rather, it was that the <i>type of weapon at
issue </i>was not eligible for <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
protection: “In the absence of any evidence tending to show that the
possession or use of a [short-barreled shotgun] at this time has some
reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well
regulated militia, we cannot say that the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> guarantees the right to keep and bear <i>such an
instrument</i>.” “Certainly,” the Court continued,
“it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the
ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the
common defense.” Beyond that, the opinion provided no explanation of
the content of the right.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This holding is not only
consistent with, but positively suggests, that the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
confers an individual right to keep and bear arms (though only arms
that “have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or
efficiency of a well regulated militia”). Had the Court believed that
the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
protects only those serving in the militia, it would have been odd to
examine the character of the weapon rather than simply note that the
two crooks were not militiamen.... <span class="smallcaps"></span><i>Miller</i>
stands only for the proposition that the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain
types of weapons.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may as well consider at this
point (for we will have to consider eventually) <i>what</i> types of
weapons <i>Miller </i>permits. Read in isolation, <i>Miller’</i>s
phrase “part of ordinary military equipment” could mean that only those
weapons useful in warfare are protected. That would be a startling
reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms
Act’s restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in <i>Miller</i>)
might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939.
We think that <i>Miller</i>’s
“ordinary military equipment” language must be read in tandem with what
comes after: “[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service
[able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by
themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.” Indeed, that is
precisely
the way in which the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> ’s
operative clause furthers the purpose announced in its preface. We
therefore read <i>Miller</i> to say only that the <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span>
does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding
citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.... <span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We conclude that nothing
in our precedents forecloses our adoption of the original understanding
of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
. It should be unsurprising that such a significant matter has been for
so long judicially unresolved. For most of our history, the Bill of
Rights was not thought applicable to the States, and the Federal
Government did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by
law-abiding citizens..... <br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;" class="opcentered">III</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most rights, the right
secured by the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases,
commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a
right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever
and for whatever purpose. For example, the majority of the 19th-century
courts to consider the
question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were
lawful under the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> or state
analogues.&nbsp; Although we do not undertake
an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding
prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally
ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places
such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions
and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.<span class=""></span>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recognize another
important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. <i>Miller </i>said,
as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those
“in common use at the time.” We think that
limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of
prohibiting the carrying of “dangerous and unusual weapons.” <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be objected that if
weapons that are
most useful in military service—M-16 rifles and the like—may be banned,
then the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have
said, the conception of the militia at the time of the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
’s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military
service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they
possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a
militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would
require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large.
Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful
against modern-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern
developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory
clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the
right.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;" class="opcentered">IV</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn finally to the law
at issue here. As we
have said, the law totally bans handgun possession in the home. It also
requires that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound
by a trigger lock at all times, rendering it inoperable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the quotations earlier
in this opinion demonstrate, the inherent right of self-defense has
been central to the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
right. The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of
“arms” that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that
lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where
the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute. Under
any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated
constitutional rights,<span class=""></span>
banning from the home “the most preferred firearm in the nation to
‘keep’ and use for protection of one’s home and family” would fail
constitutional muster. </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few laws in the history of
our Nation have come
close to the severe restriction of the District’s handgun ban... <br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also address the
District’s requirement
(as applied to respondent’s handgun) that firearms in the home be
rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for
citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is
hence unconstitutional. The District argues that we should interpret
this element of the statute to contain an exception for self-defense.
But we think that is precluded by the
unequivocal text, and by the presence of certain other enumerated
exceptions: “Except for law enforcement personnel …&nbsp;, each
registrant
shall keep any firearm in his possession unloaded and disassembled or
bound by a trigger lock or similar device unless such firearm is kept
at his place of business, or while being used for lawful recreational
purposes within the District of Columbia.” <span class=""></span> </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from his challenge to
the handgun ban and
the trigger-lock requirement respondent asked the District Court to
enjoin petitioners from enforcing the separate licensing requirement
“in such a manner as to forbid the carrying of a firearm within one’s
home or possessed land without a license.....” Respondent
conceded at oral argument that he does not “have a problem with …
licensing” and that the District’s law is permissible so long as it is
“not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner.” We therefore
assume that petitioners’ issuance of a license will
satisfy respondent’s prayer for relief and do not address the licensing
requirement....</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smallcaps">Justice
Breyer</span> moves on to make a broad jurisprudential point: He
criticizes us for declining to establish a level of scrutiny for
evaluating <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
restrictions. He proposes, explicitly at least, none of the
traditionally expressed levels (strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny,
rational basis), but rather a judge-empowering “interest-balancing
inquiry” that “asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in
a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute’s
salutary effects upon other important governmental interests.” <i></i>After
an exhaustive discussion of the arguments for and against gun control, <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span>
arrives at his interest-balanced answer: because handgun violence is a
problem, because the law is limited to an urban area, and because there
were somewhat similar restrictions in the founding period (a false
proposition that we have already discussed), the interest-balancing
inquiry results in the constitutionality of the handgun ban. QED.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know of no other
enumerated constitutional
right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding
“interest-balancing” approach. The very enumeration of the right takes
out of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of Government—the
power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is <i>really
worth</i>
insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges’
assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all.
Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood
to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future
legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We
would not<span class="smallcaps"></span> apply an “interest-balancing”
approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through
Skokie.&nbsp; The <span class="subref">First Amendment</span>
contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified,
which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state
secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and
wrong-headed views. The <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
is no different. Like the First, it is the very <i>product</i> of an
interest-balancing by the people—which <span class="smallcaps">Justice
Breyer </span>would
now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future
evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of
law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and
home....</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smallcaps"></span>And
there will be time enough to expound upon
the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if
and when those exceptions come before us.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, we hold that the
District’s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the
home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense. Assuming that
Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of <span class="subref">Second
Amendment</span> rights, the District must permit him to register his
handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.</p>
<p class="opcentered">*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of the problem
of handgun violence in this country, and we take seriously the concerns
raised by the many <i>amici</i>
who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution. The
Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for
combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns.
But the enshrinement of
constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the
table. These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used
for self-defense in the home. Undoubtedly some think that the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span>
is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our
Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and
where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but
what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to
pronounce the <span class="subref">Second Amendment</span> extinct.</p>
