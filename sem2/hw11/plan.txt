THE PLAN:
Some observations;
-	There is a 6X6 grid of possible moves for a knight; 6X6 is the minimum size for the knights tour to work(this is based off a lot of experimentation).

1.	Begin in middle of board.
2.	Find possible position for knight in 6X6 radius
3.	IF There are no possible positions, then move back to previous position, and try to find another position.
a.	If there are no moves available, then keep on backtracking until there is another “path of possibility”
4.	ELSE  move it into an available position.
Continue until:
a.	There are squares that are unreachable
b.	All squares have been visited
